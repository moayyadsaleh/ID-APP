          <strong>Self-directed learning (SDL):</strong><br />
          â€¢ The learner's active role in their own learning process, where the
          learner takes the initiative in diagnosing their learning needs,
          formulating goals, identifying resources, and evaluating their
          progress.<br />
          â€¢ I always use this theory when learners typically have more life
          experience and are more motivated to take control of their
          education.<br />
          â€¢ Learning experiences must encourage learners to take ownership of
          their learning, provide options for choosing topics, projects, or
          learning paths, and give the options for the learner to set their own
          learning objectives.<br />
          â€¢ Allow the learner to identify and utilize various resources or
          provide a curated list of articles, videos, and tools relevant to the
          course material.<br />
          â€¢ Incorporating reflective practices encourages learners to assess
          their understanding and adjust their learning paths accordingly.<br />
          â€¢ Instructional materials and activities should be designed to allow
          for personalization, enabling learners to choose content and methods
          that resonate with them.<br />
