          1. Andragogy (Malcolm Knowles)<br />
          • Andragogy refers to the method and practice of teaching adults.<br />
          • It is the art and science of helping adults learn Unlike pedagogy,
          which focuses on teaching children<br />
          • Andragogy recognizes that adults have different learning needs and
          experiences.<br />
          • For me as a designer, this theory will inform the creation of
          educational experiences specifically tailored for adult learners. For
          example, this theory suggests that:<br />
          • Adults are Self-Directed Learners:<br />
          • Adults bring a wealth of Experience as a Resource to the learning
          process<br />
          • Adults Are Relevance-Oriented Learners, and bring Readiness to
          Learn:<br />
          • Adults Are Practical and Problem-Centered Learners<br />
          • Adults are Active Learners not passive learners:<br />
          <strong>ID Implications of Andragogy:</strong><br />
          A. Adults are Self-Directed Learners:<br />
          • They prefer to take charge of their own learning<br />
          • They like to set their own goals and determine their learning
          paths.<br />
          • They like to pick when they want to learn and how they want to
          learn.<br />
          Based on this theory, I create materials that:<br />
          • empower adults to take charge of their education<br />
          • I include options for self-assessment and multiple learning
          paths.<br />
          • Offer various formats and methods to suit their preferences and
          schedules.<br />
          • Provide additional resources to encourage autonomy.<br /><br />

          B. Adults bring a wealth of Experience as a Resource to the learning
          process:<br />
          • Which means their prior knowledge/ prior experiences can be
          leveraged to enhance their learning, deepening understanding, and
          improving retention.<br />
          • I incorporate activities like case studies, simulations, and group
          discussions to activate prior knowledge.<br />
          • in a conflict resolution course activity can allow learners to draw
          on their own experiences dealing with workplace disagreements. They
          can discuss the problems encountered conflicts and discuss the
          approaches they took to resolving them.<br />
          • Activities also include real-world scenarios that encourage them to
          analyze the situation based on their experiences.<br />
          • And activities that encourage Group Discussions, allowing learners
          to share their experiences<br /><br />

          C. Adults Are Relevance-Oriented Learners, and bring Readiness to
          Learn:<br />
          • They are driven by internal motivations<br />
          • They get motivated when they see the materials relate to their
          personal or professional growth, like job growth rather than external
          rewards like grades or badges.<br />
          • Their learning experiences must be practical, real-life-focused,
          problem-based and relevant to their goals and needs.<br />
          • For a customer service course, I would connect activities to
          employees' real needs, such as role-playing exercises based on actual
          customer interactions.<br /><br />

          D. Adults Are Practical and Problem-Centered Learners<br />
          • They learn best through solving real-life problems, not abstract
          theories.<br />
          • They're motivated to apply knowledge to practical issues in their
          personal or professional lives.<br />
          • I design courses around authentic challenges, using real-world
          scenarios and case studies requiring critical thinking.<br />
          • I would include Real-World Scenarios, case studies that present
          complex, real-world problems requiring critical thinking
          problem-solving.<br />
          • For example, in a project management course, I might use a case
          study of a project failure due to miscommunication.<br />
          • I also include simulations, like role-playing in a customer service
          course, to help learners practice resolving real-world issues.<br /><br />

          E. Adults are Active Learners not passive learners:<br />
          • Adults are active learners rather than passive recipients of
          information.<br />
          • lectures aren’t the best way to teach adults because of their
          passive nature, their disconnection from the learners’ real-life
          practice, and the effort learners have to put in to maintain
          attention.<br />
          • Adults engage more effectively in the learning process when they can
          actively participate, apply concepts, and explore ideas through
          hands-on experiences.<br />
          • Courses must incorporate various interactive activities, such as
          discussions, role plays, and problem-solving exercises.<br />
          • For a negotiation skills course, I might create simulations where
          learners practice negotiating in pairs or small groups.<br />
          • in a self-paced negotiation skills course, I would for instance,
          include multimedia resources, such as video scenarios depicting
          different negotiation styles, online role-playing exercises where
          learners can record their negotiation attempts and receive feedback
          from peers or facilitators.<br /><br />

          F. Adults are Goal-Oriented<br />
          • Adults are motivated when learning aligns with their personal or
          professional goals and provides practical benefits.<br />
          • I ensure course objectives clearly show how each lesson helps them
          achieve a specific goal, such as improving a job-related skill.<br />
          • In a leadership course, for example, I would explain how mastering
          communication techniques enhances team management.<br />
          • I could include goal-setting activities at the start, asking
          learners to identify specific outcomes and showing how the course will
          guide them toward that objective.<br /><br />

          G. Adults are Task-Oriented<br />
          • Adults prefer practical, task-based content over purely
          informational material.<br />
          • I incorporate hands-on activities and problem-solving tasks, like
          completing real-life projects, rather than just delivering
          information.<br />
          • In a course on data analysis, I would assign a task-based project
          where learners analyze a dataset relevant to their industry, to
          reinforce and apply what they’ve learned.<br />
          • I also use project-based learning, where learners work on tasks like
          designing a marketing campaign or managing a team, applying knowledge
          incrementally as they progress.<br /><br />

          H. Adults are Practical<br />
          • They want to solve problems and apply learning immediately.<br />
          • I design practical assignments, like creating a work-related
          proposal or completing real-world tasks, where learners use new
          knowledge right away.<br />
          • In a business strategy course, for example, learners might develop a
          strategic plan for their company, applying learned frameworks.<br />
          • I also include workplace simulations or scenario-based assessments
          where learners practice handling real-life situations, like team
          conflicts or process improvements.<br /><br />

          2. Transformative Learning (Mezirow):<br />
          • This theory focuses on critical reflection, encouraging learners to
          challenge their assumptions and transform their perspectives through
          new experiences.<br />
          • When the goal of the course is to facilitate significant changes in
          learners' behavior, attitudes, or skills—such as leadership
          development, conflict resolution, or diversity training,
          transformative learning can help guide the design to promote deep
          understanding and change.<br />
          • Activities must challenge learner's assumptions and worldview and
          promote personal growth. I would integrate reflective activities,
          discussion prompts, and scenarios that encourage learners to question
          their perspectives. journaling prompts, reflective questions, or
          guided discussions to encourage learners to think critically about
          their experiences and beliefs.<br />
          • I would use real-life scenarios that challenge existing viewpoints,
          prompting learners to analyze and reflect on their assumptions and
          consider alternative perspectives.<br />
          • For example, in a leadership course, I might ask learners to reflect
          on different leadership styles and how they align with their
          experiences and values.<br />
