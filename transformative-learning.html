          <strong>2. Transformative Learning (Mezirow):</strong><br />
          â€¢ This theory focuses on critical reflection, encouraging learners to
          challenge their assumptions and transform their perspectives through
          new experiences.<br />
          â€¢ When the goal of the course is to facilitate significant changes in
          learners' behavior, attitudes, or skillsâ€”such as leadership
          development, conflict resolution, or diversity training,
          transformative learning can help guide the design to promote deep
          understanding and change.<br />
          â€¢ Activities must challenge learner's assumptions and worldview and
          promote personal growth. I would integrate reflective activities,
          discussion prompts, and scenarios that encourage learners to question
          their perspectives. Journaling prompts, reflective questions, or
          guided discussions to encourage learners to think critically about
          their experiences and beliefs.<br />
          â€¢ I would use real-life scenarios that challenge existing viewpoints,
          prompting learners to analyze and reflect on their assumptions and
          consider alternative perspectives.<br />
          â€¢ For example, in a leadership course, I might ask learners to reflect
          on different leadership styles and how they align with their
          experiences and values.<br />
