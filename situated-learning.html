          <strong>Situated Learning (Similar to Task-Based):</strong><br />
          â€¢ Situated learning theory posits that knowledge is best acquired in
          the context in which it will be used and emphasizes the importance of
          context and social interaction in the learning process. It posits that
          knowledge is best acquired through engagement in real-life situations
          where learners can apply what theyâ€™ve learned.<br />
          â€¢ Instructional materials must immerse learners in authentic contexts
          and promote collaborative learning. Activities must reflect real-life
          situations relevant to learners' fields.<br />
          â€¢ Their learning must be focused on relevant, real-life tasks that
          mimic the challenges they might face in their professions.<br />
          â€¢ In a business course, learners could work on developing a marketing
          strategy for a local company, giving them hands-on experience that is
          directly applicable to their future careers.<br />
          â€¢ Instructional materials must include collaborative projects where
          learners work together to solve problems or create solutions. This
          could include group discussions, peer evaluations, or joint
          presentations.<br />
          â€¢ Case studies, simulations, or role-playing scenarios that allow
          learners to explore how theories manifest in real-world situations.
          For example, in a course on conflict resolution, learners could
          role-play scenarios that require them to apply conflict management
          techniques.<br />
          â€¢ Assessments must be in context and reflect the authentic tasks
          learners engage in during the course. This might include project-based
          assessments where learners demonstrate their understanding through
          practical application.<br />
