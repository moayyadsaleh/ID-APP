          The goal of Action Mapping is to ‚Äúchange what people do, not just what
          they know [with] action-packed materials that are 100% dedicated to
          improving business performance.‚Äù Action Mapping results in real
          actions, rather than merely delivering information.<br /><br />

          The Action Mapping model includes four steps that act as the backbone
          of your eLearning course creation.<br />
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>Identify the business goal:</strong> Identifying the
          business goal keeps the course focused on what the learners need to
          know, rather than including all of the information. A measurable
          business goal will help you design relevant activities, identify the
          most important content, evaluate success, and show the value of
          training.<br />
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>Identify what people need to do:</strong> This step
          pinpoints all of the steps or actions that employees need to take to
          achieve the business goal.<br />
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>Design practice activities:</strong> Practice activities
          refer to real activities or tasks that employees perform in the
          workplace.<br />
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>Identify what people need to know:</strong> Include the
          minimum amount of information that your employees must have to
          complete each practice activity. If the information doesn‚Äôt directly
          support an activity, don‚Äôt add it.<br /><br />
