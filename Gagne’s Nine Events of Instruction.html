          â€¢ It is a framework to structure and deliver effective learning
          experiences. The model provides a systematic approach to ensure
          learners are engaged, understand the content, and can apply it in
          practical situations.<br /><br />

          <strong>Phases:</strong><br />
          1. <strong>Gain Attention:</strong> Use attention-grabbing techniques
          to capture learners' interest (e.g., use a provocative question or
          interesting fact). Use an engaging and relevant story. Include a
          fun/engaging activity (for example, letting the user make a choice
          about the experience, such as choosing an avatar or color scheme). Ask
          a thought-provoking question. Show a relevant, entertaining video or
          animation.<br />
          2. <strong>Inform Learners of Objectives:</strong> Tell learners what
          theyâ€™ll achieve. Helps learners understand what they are expected to
          achieve, aligning their focus and motivation with the instructional
          goals.<br />
          3. <strong>Stimulate Recall of Prior Learning:</strong> Connect new
          learning with previous knowledge. Helps learners connect new
          information with what they already know, creating a stronger cognitive
          link and improving retention.<br />
          4. <strong>Present the Content:</strong> Deliver new information.<br />
          5. <strong>Provide Learning Guidance:</strong> Offer hints, examples,
          or explanations. Offer additional support to help learners process the
          information, such as examples, analogies, and tips, which assist in
          understanding complex concepts.<br />
          6. <strong>Elicit Performance (Practice):</strong> Give learners the
          chance to practice a new skill. Help learners solidify their
          understanding by applying what they've learned, and link theory with
          practice.<br />
          7. <strong>Provide Feedback:</strong> Give corrective or reinforcing
          feedback. Ensures that learners understand their mistakes and know how
          to correct and polish them.<br />
          8. <strong>Assess Performance:</strong> Test or assess learning.
          Evaluate the learnersâ€™ understanding and mastery of the material.<br />
          9. <strong>Enhance Retention and Transfer:</strong> Help learners
          apply new skills in different contexts. Ensures that learners not only
          remember the content but can also apply it in real-life contexts.<br />
