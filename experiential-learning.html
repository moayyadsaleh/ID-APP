          <strong>3. Experiential Learning (Kolb):</strong> This theory
          emphasizes knowledge through experience where learning is gained
          through direct experience and reflection, active participation, and
          learning by doing that requires hands-on activities for applying
          theoretical concepts.<br /><br />

          <strong>Summary of Experiential Learning Cycle:</strong><br />
          â€¢ Concrete Experience: Learners actively engage in an experience.<br />
          â€¢ Reflective Observation: Learners reflect on the experience to
          understand what happened.<br />
          â€¢ Abstract Conceptualization: Learners form theories or
          generalizations based on reflections.<br />
          â€¢ Active Experimentation: Learners apply new knowledge to test its
          validity in real-world situations.<br /><br />

          â€¢ It suggests that adults benefit from hands-on activities that
          connect theory to real-world situations.<br />
          â€¢ Foster teamwork and communication by creating collaborative
          projects.<br />
          â€¢ In a project management course, learners work on detailed project
          plans, execute it, and then implement the plan in a real-world
          context.<br />
          â€¢ Incorporate structured reflection activities to help learners assess
          their experiences.<br />
          â€¢ Materials should facilitate and support learnersâ€™ experiences rather
          than just provide information.<br />
          â€¢ Create an environment where learners can take risks, ask questions,
          and explore new ideas.<br />
          â€¢ In assessment, incorporating reflective activities, such as journals
          or discussions, can enhance the learning process and provide valuable
          feedback.<br />
