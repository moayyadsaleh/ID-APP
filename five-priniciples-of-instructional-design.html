          <strong>What are the five principles of instructional design?</strong
          ><br /><br />

          <strong
            >1. Merrillâ€™s First Principles of Instruction (Problem-based and
            real-world focused):</strong
          ><br />
          â€¢ It suggests that Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in
          solving real-world problems.<br />
          â€¢ I rely on it to create highly effective and engaging learning
          experiences by focusing on real-world problem-solving and active
          learner engagement.<br />
          â€¢ It is important to rely on because it ensures that learners can not
          only absorb information but also apply it in practical contexts.<br />
          â€¢ If I am designing a learning course or program for Real-World
          Application, where learners need to acquire and apply skills they can
          immediately apply in practical, real-world settings, like
          troubleshooting equipment or managing customer service
          interactions.<br />
          â€¢ Encourage active learning through tasks and projects that require
          application and active learning, where the learner is engaged in
          problem-solving and discovery rather than passively receiving
          information.<br />
          â€¢ I also use it when the learner is expected to acquire not just
          knowledge but also complex skills that require analysis and
          decision-making.<br /><br />

          <strong>Phases:</strong><br />
          1. <strong>Problem-Centered:</strong> Learning is promoted when
          learners are engaged in solving real-world problems.<br />
          2. <strong>Activation of Prior Knowledge:</strong> Build on learnersâ€™
          prior knowledge before introducing new content. I use techniques like
          questioning, reviewing previous knowledge, or providing context to
          help learners connect new concepts to what they already know.<br />
          3. <strong>Demonstration of Newly Acquired Skills:</strong> Show
          learners how to apply new knowledge or skills.<br />
          4. <strong>Application of Learning:</strong> Learners should apply
          their knowledge and skills in practice. I create activities,
          assignments, and projects where learners can practice what theyâ€™ve
          learned.<br />
          5. <strong>Integration of Learning into Real-Life:</strong> Encourage
          learners to integrate new knowledge into their world.<br />
