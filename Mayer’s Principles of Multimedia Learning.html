          • Mayer’s Principles of Multimedia Learning explain how to use
          structured multimedia learning.<br />
          • These principles are grounded in cognitive psychology and aim to
          enhance understanding and retention by considering how learners
          process multimedia information.<br />
          • It helps manage cognitive load, ensuring that learners can
          effectively process information without being overwhelmed.<br />
          • It supports Dual Coding Theory. Mayer’s work aligns with dual coding
          theory, which suggests that combining verbal and visual information
          enhances learning.<br />
          • Following these principles helps minimize cognitive overload,
          allowing learners to focus on understanding the material. Don’t
          overwhelm the learner with the amount of information they exceed their
          cognitive capacity, making it difficult to process and retain new
          information. This phenomenon occurs when learners are faced with too
          much information at once or when the information is too complex,
          leading to confusion and frustration.<br /><br />

          <strong>1. Multimedia Principle:</strong> Use text and graphics
          instead of just text.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Combining text and graphics helps reinforce
          concepts, making it easier for learners to understand and remember
          information.<br /><br />

          <strong>2. Contiguity Principle:</strong> Align graphics with the text
          they describe.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Proximity between text and graphics allows
          learners to make connections more easily, reducing cognitive load.<br /><br />

          <strong>3. Modality Principle:</strong> Use narration to describe
          graphics rather than on-screen text.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Narration paired with visuals enhances
          understanding by allowing learners to focus on processing the image
          without the distraction of reading.<br /><br />

          <strong>4. Redundancy Principle:</strong> Explain visuals with
          narration or text, but not both.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Presenting both can overwhelm learners and lead
          to confusion, hindering their ability to process information
          effectively.<br /><br />

          <strong>5. Coherence Principle (Relevancy):</strong> Adding irrelevant
          content can hurt the learning experience.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Extraneous information distracts learners and
          increases cognitive overload, making it harder to grasp key
          concepts.<br /><br />

          <strong>6. Personalization Principle:</strong> Use a conversational
          style and a human voice.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> A friendly, relatable tone can increase learner
          engagement and motivation, making the learning experience more
          enjoyable.<br /><br />

          <strong>7. Embodiment Principle:</strong> Use on-screen coaches and
          characters.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Engaging characters can provide social presence,
          enhancing connection and interaction, which may boost learning.<br /><br />

          <strong>8. Segmenting Principle:</strong> Break a continuous lesson
          into bite-sized segments.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Smaller segments allow learners to process
          information more thoroughly and control their learning pace, reducing
          cognitive overload.<br /><br />

          <strong>9. Pretraining Principle:</strong> Introduce key terms and
          concepts beforehand.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Familiarizing learners with essential terms
          prepares them to understand the main content more effectively,
          enhancing comprehension.<br /><br />

          <strong>10. Signaling Principle:</strong> Guide the learner’s
          attention with visual cues.<br />
          <strong>Why:</strong> Visual cues help direct focus to important
          information, aiding in the retention and understanding of key
          concepts.<br />
