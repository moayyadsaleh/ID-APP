          <strong>SAM (Successive Approximation Model)</strong><br />
          â€¢ Agile and iterative approach to instructional design.<br />
          â€¢ It also emphasizes rapid prototyping and frequent feedback, allowing
          me to develop effective learning experiences more efficiently.<br />
          â€¢ I would use it when the project requirements are not well-defined
          (Designing a training program for a new software tool where user needs
          may evolve as development progresses.), Short Development Timelines (A
          company needing to train employees on new compliance regulations
          within a tight deadline.), High Stakeholder Involvement (Working on a
          corporate training initiative where input from department heads and
          learners is crucial for success.), Focus on User-Centered Design.
          SAMâ€™s iterative nature allows for exploration and refinement based on
          ongoing feedback.<br />
          â€¢ SAM focuses on agile development, allowing instructional designers
          to make adjustments quickly and improve learning materials in
          real-time, based on feedback.<br />
          â€¢ Involves learners throughout the process, ensuring that the final
          product is highly tailored to their needs.<br />
          â€¢ SAMâ€™s design process is iterative, promoting the development of
          prototypes, gathering feedback, and refining materials repeatedly.
          This leads to a better final product.<br />
          â€¢ SAM encourages rapid prototyping, which speeds up the development
          process, allowing for quicker delivery of instructional materials.<br />
          â€¢ SAM fosters collaboration among instructional designers, subject
          matter experts (SMEs), and stakeholders, leading to a more
          comprehensive understanding of learner needs.<br />
          â€¢ By incorporating learner feedback at multiple stages, SAM helps
          create more engaging and relevant learning experiences tailored to the
          audience's needs.<br />
          â€¢ By testing prototypes early and often, SAM helps identify potential
          issues before the final product is released, reducing the risk of
          costly revisions later.<br /><br />

          <strong>Phases:</strong><br />
          1. <strong>Preparation:</strong> Gather information about learners and
          content.<br />
          2. <strong>Iterative Design:</strong> Create prototypes and gather
          feedback, allowing the design to evolve through multiple
          iterations.<br />
          3. <strong>Iterative Development:</strong> Develop and test the
          learning materials in phases, improving them based on learner
          feedback.<br />
